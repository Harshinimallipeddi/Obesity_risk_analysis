# ðŸ“Š Obesity Risk Analysis using Python

This project focuses on analyzing obesity risk factors through data science techniques. 
We employed Python for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), followed by the implementation of accurate machine learning models for predictive analysis. 
Our goal was to derive meaningful insights from the data and visualize them using PowerBI
